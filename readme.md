# QuotePost browser extension

**This is a very rough work in progress. You have been warned**

Add quote posts to Mastodon. Run this as a browser extension and apply it to the domains you wish.

- [x] Detect links that look like Mastodon links and convert them to embeds
- [ ] Add a button to posts to quote post it
- [ ] Bug finding and fixing. I assume my bad JS is bad
- [ ] Add boost style dual-profile pics for quote posting
